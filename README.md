# Banking System Project Overview
## Introduction
The Banking System Project is a web-based application that will allow customers to access their account information, perform transactions, and manage their finances online. The system will be built using Spring Boot, React/Vue, and MySQL.

## Requirements
The Banking System Project will include the following functional and non-functional requirements:

### Functional Requirements
    1. User registration and login
    2. Account management (view account details, transfer funds, request statements)
    3. Loan management (apply for a loan, view loan status, make payments)
    4. Credit card management (apply for a credit card, view credit card status, make payments)
### Non-functional Requirements
    1. Security (data encryption, authentication, and authorization)
    2. Performance (fast response times, scalable architecture)
    3. Reliability (high availability, data backups)
    4. Accessibility (support for multiple devices and browsers)
## Technical Details
The Banking System Project will be developed using the following technologies:

    1. Spring Boot for the backend
    2. React/Vue for the frontend
    3. MySQL for the database
    4. Maven for build and dependency management
## API Definition
The API for the Banking System Project will include the following endpoints:

/register (POST) - Register a new user
/login (POST) - Login a user
/accounts (GET) - Get all accounts for a user
/accounts/{id} (GET) - Get account details for a specific account

Authentication and authorization will be handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Testing Plan
The following types of tests will be performed:

    1. Unit tests for backend code
    2. Integration tests for API endpoints
    3. End-to-end tests for frontend functionality
    4. Testing will be performed using JUnit, Mockito, and Protractor.

## Documentation Plan
The documentation for the Banking System Project will include the following:

    1. API documentation (generated using Spring REST Docs)
    2. User documentation (including instructions on how to use the system)
    3. Technical documentation (including architecture diagrams and code documentation)
    4. Documentation will be generated using Swagger, AsciiDoc, and Confluence.

## Collaboration Guidelines
The following guidelines will be followed for collaboration among developers:

Code reviews will be conducted using GitHub pull requests
Issues will be tracked using GitHub issues
Communication will be handled using Slack and email
## Timeline
The Banking System Project will be completed in six months, with the following milestones:
